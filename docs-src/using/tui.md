Run `prioricode` in a project and you get one screen: your prompt at the bottom, the conversation above, a sidebar to the side. Everything else is a keystroke away.

## Sessions

A session starts the moment you submit your first prompt — there's no ceremony. Sessions are stored in the local database with a generated title (say `/rename` if you disagree with the one it picked). See [sessions](sessions.md) for resuming, forking, undo, and the storage story.

- `/new` (or `<leader>n`) starts a fresh session; `/sessions` (`<leader>l`) lists and resumes old ones.
- `<leader>1`…`<leader>9` are quick slots — pin a session in the list with `ctrl+f` and jump back with one chord.
- In `--auto`-free workflows, the agent stops and asks; see [permissions](permissions.md).

## Writing prompts

The input is a text editor in disguise. Standard bindings (`ctrl+a`/`ctrl+e`, word-wise `alt+f`/`alt+b`, `ctrl+w`, kill lines with `ctrl+u`/`ctrl+k`), multi-line with `shift+return` (or `ctrl+return`, `alt+return`, `ctrl+j`), and `up`/`down` walks your prompt history.

### `@` mentions

Type `@` to attach context, fuzzy-searched and ranked by how often you touch the files:

| Syntax | Attaches |
| --- | --- |
| `@src/api.ts` | a file (or `@src/routes/` a directory) |
| `@src/api.ts#10-20` | just lines 10–20 |
| `@general` | a subagent — routes the message through it |
| `@<name>` | a project reference (configured `references`) |
| MCP resources | when a connected server exposes them |

Slash commands complete from `/` at the start of a line — the full list is on the [slash-commands reference](../reference/slash-commands.md).

### Shell mode

Start an empty prompt with `!` and the next line runs in your shell, no model involved. Output stays in the transcript. `escape` (or backspace at the start) drops back to normal.

## Getting things in

- **Paste an image or PDF** with `ctrl+v` — it becomes an `[Image 1]` / `[PDF 1]` chip in your message and a real attachment on send.
- **Paste long text** (3+ lines or >150 chars) and it collapses to a `[Pasted ~N lines]` chip that expands when you submit, keeping the transcript readable.
- **Paste a file path or URL** and it attaches itself — text inlined, binaries as attachments.
- **Pipe into the prompt:** `cat error.log | prioricode --prompt "why did this fail"` — piped stdin is prepended to the prompt.
- **From your editor:** the TUI picks up Zed's current selection as context, and `$EDITOR` integration works via `/editor` (see below).

## While the agent is working

Keep typing — the input never blocks. New messages queue (you'll see a **QUEUED** badge) and are picked up as soon as the loop can take them. Manage the queue with `<leader>q`.

**To stop it:** press `escape` — the footer says "again to interrupt". Press `escape` a second time within five seconds and the session is aborted mid-step.

## Your other keys

`ctrl+p` opens the command palette: every command, searchable, no memorization required. The big-ticket defaults:

| Keys | Command |
| --- | --- |
| `ctrl+x` | the leader key — prefix for most chords below (2 s window) |
| `tab` / `shift+tab` | next / previous agent |
| `<leader>m`, `f2` | model list / cycle recent models |
| `<leader>c` | compact the session |
| `<leader>u` / `<leader>r` | undo / redo the last message |
| `<leader>b` | hide the sidebar when you want the conversation full-bleed |
| `<leader>e` | compose in `$EDITOR` |
| `/help` | keybinding cheatsheet in-app |

The complete table lives in the [keybinds reference](../reference/keybinds.md), and all of it is rebindable in `tui.json` — see [themes & keybindings](../configure/tui.md).

## Sidebar & reading the screen

The sidebar carries the todo list (when the agent is planning multi-step work), context usage (tokens used vs the model's window), and your spend for the session. Press `<leader>h` to hide/show tool code, toggle timestamps with `/timestamps`, and cycle how much "thinking" is displayed with `/thinking`. The permission panel renders diffs — `ctrl+f` blows it up to fullscreen when the diff deserves it.

## Exporting the conversation

- `/copy` puts a formatted transcript on your clipboard.
- `/export` opens a dialog (include thinking? tool details? metadata?) and hands you a markdown file — in `$EDITOR` if you have one set.

## Mini mode

`prioricode --mini` is the same sessions, the same server, a much smaller footprint — a split-footer interface for tmux panes and SSH sessions over flaky connections. It speaks `/editor`, `/new`, `/exit`, and pipes cleanly; see [headless & scripting](headless.md).
