title: "Sessions"
description: "Create, resume, fork, undo, compact, share, export, and delete PrioriCode sessions — and where they live on disk."
---

Every conversation PrioriCode has with you is a **session**: a stream of messages, tool calls, file diffs, todos, and costs, all living in one database. Sessions are also where subagents do their work — each task spawns a child session you can jump into.

## Creating and resuming

::: code-group

```bash [In the TUI]
prioricode                    # new session in the current project
prioricode --continue         # jump back into the latest session
prioricode --session ses_…    # resume a specific one
```

```bash [From the CLI]
prioricode session list               # recent sessions, paginated
prioricode session list --format json # machine-readable
prioricode session delete ses_…
```

:::

Inside the TUI: `/sessions` (or `<leader>l`) is the resume dialog, `/new` starts fresh, and `/rename` fixes the title. The agent auto-generates a title after your first message — usually better than what you would have typed.

Sessions form a tree: when the agent dispatches a subagent, that's a child session. Follow it with `<leader>down` (first child), `left`/`right` (cycle siblings), and `up` (back to the parent).

## Fork, undo, redo

The agent went down a rabbit hole? Time-travel instead of apologizing:

- **`/undo`** reverts the last user message and everything that followed — files on disk are restored from the snapshot, and the message text lands back in your prompt, ready to edit and resubmit.
- **`/redo`** steps the reverts forward again, restoring what you undid.
- **`/fork`** (or `/timeline` → pick a message) branches the conversation up to that point into a new session, titled `… (fork #N)`. The original stays untouched.
- `--fork` on the CLI does the same from the latest (or `--session`) state.

:::info
Revert state is transient: send a new message and the undo chain is cleaned up. Undo, then undo again, then act — don't undo after the fact.

## Compaction

Every model has a context window; long sessions fill it. When you approach the limit, PrioriCode **compacts**: it summarizes older history and keeps the recent turns verbatim.

```bash
/compact        # or /summarize — do it yourself, before you have to
```

The `compaction` config block tunes the whole system — automatic vs manual, the threshold at which it fires, how much recent context survives (`tail_turns`, `preserve_recent_tokens`, `reserved`), and `prune`, which drops old tool output (the defaults keep everything; pruning saves tokens once a session gets chatty). Details in the [config reference](../reference/config.md).

## Sharing & export

- `/share` produces a read-only web page of the transcript (with a consent prompt the first time — read it, it's honest about what leaves your machine). `/unshare` deletes it. See [sharing](sharing.md).
- `prioricode export [sessionID]` writes the full session as JSON; add `--sanitize` to redact transcript and file contents for bug reports.
- `prioricode import <file-or-share-url>` brings an export or a shared link back into a local session — the fastest way to reproduce someone else's debugging session.

## Usage stats

```bash
prioricode stats --days 7       # last week of tokens and cost
prioricode stats --tools        # which tools the agent leaned on
prioricode stats --models       # per-model breakdown
prioricode stats --project ""   # just this project
```

Totals, per-day cost, input/output/reasoning/cache tokens — straight from the session records, no account required.

## Where sessions live

Sessions, messages, parts, and todos live in a SQLite database, not in scattered JSON files:

```bash
prioricode db path              # the resolved file, e.g. ~/.local/share/prioricode/prioricode.db
prioricode db                  # interactive sqlite3 shell
prioricode db "select id,title from session order by time_updated desc limit 10" --format tsv
```

Different release channels use different DB files, and `PRIORICODE_DB` overrides the whole thing — the routing rules are on the [config files page](../configure/files.md).

:::warning
The database contains your prompts, file contents, and diffs. It's local — but local files are still files. Back it up or wipe it like you would an SSH keychain.
