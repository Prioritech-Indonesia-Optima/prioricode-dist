title: "Sharing & export"
description: "Share a session as a web page, automate sharing with share:auto, take links back down with /unshare, and move sessions with export/import."

Sometimes the most useful thing an agent produced is the story of how it worked. Sharing publishes that story — and this page is honest about what that means.

## Manual sharing

```
/share      # in the TUI → creates the link, copies it to your clipboard
/unshare    # deletes it; the link stops working immediately
```

The first time you share in a session group, PrioriCode shows a consent prompt explaining what leaves your machine. Read it — it's the one screen where you decide what a share is.

A share is a **read-only transcript page**: messages, tool calls, diffs, rendered by the hosted share service. The default backend is `https://opncd.ai`; point it at your own deployment with the `enterprise.url` config (self-hostable — see [enterprise](../platforms/enterprise.md)). Share URLs look like `https://<host>/share/<slug>`.

:::warning
Assume every share is public and permanent-until-deleted. Transcripts contain your prompts and file contents the agent read. If secrets were in context, they're in the page. `/unshare` is the undo; `PRIORICODE_DISABLE_SHARE=1` is the insurance policy; `"share": "disabled"` in config removes `/share` from the TUI entirely.
:::

## Automatic sharing

```jsonc
// prioricode.json
{ "share": "auto" }
```

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"manual"` (default) | Links exist only when you `/share`. |
| `"auto"` | Every session gets shared as it runs — for teams who review sessions openly. |
| `"disabled"` | No sharing anywhere: TUI entry hidden, server routes off. |

Equivalent one-offs: the `PRIORICODE_AUTO_SHARE=1` env, `autoshare: true` (legacy spelling of `share: auto`), and `prioricode run --share`.

Live updates: a shared session streams its ongoing changes to the page — your colleague watches the agent work, not just the result.

## Export & import: sessions as files

Sharing is for eyeballs; export/import is for machines and archives.

```bash
prioricode export                      # pick a session interactively
prioricode export ses_… > session.json # or grab a specific one
prioricode export --sanitize ses_…     # redact transcript + file data for bug reports
prioricode import session.json         # back into a local session
prioricode import https://opncd.ai/share/abc123   # or straight from a share link
```

The export is the full record — session, messages, parts, todos. `--sanitize` replaces sensitive payloads with `[redacted:kind:id]` markers so you can attach an export to an issue without turning it into a data leak. Importing a sanitized export keeps the structure; the agent just can't see what you redacted.

For CI archaeology: `prioricode session list --format json` gives IDs programmatically, `run --session <id> --continue` resumes them, and `stats` tallies them. See [headless](headless.md).

## What sharing is not

- Not a sync mechanism — for two machines, use the [server](../platforms/server.md).
- Not collaboration — viewers can't reply or steer; the page is a recording.
- Not scoped to a subset — you share the whole session, not a message. Copy what you need (`/copy`) for smaller pieces.
