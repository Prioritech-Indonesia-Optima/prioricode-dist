title: "Tools reference"
description: "Every tool the agent can call — parameters, caps, defaults, availability gates: read, edit, write, apply_patch, bash, glob, grep, task, todowrite, question, plan, skill, webfetch, websearch, lsp, sessions, jobs, code-mode."
---

Tools are the agent's hands. Each one is permission-gated by its name (see the `permission` table's known keys), and each row here is verified against the tool source. "Gate" = when the tool exists at all; most are always available.

## File & code

| Tool | Params | Behavior & limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **read** | `filePath` (abs), `offset?`, `limit?` | Text: up to 2,000 lines, lines cut at 2,000 chars, 50 KB per response. Directories listed one-per-line (`/` suffix). Images (jpeg/png/gif/webp) and PDFs come back as attachments. Binary refused. Near-miss names suggest up to 3 candidates. Warms LSP. `*.env` asks by default. |
| **write** | `filePath`, `content` | Create/overwrite (read-first is required by convention, restated every session). Formats after write, appends LSP diagnostics for the file + up to 5 other open files. |
| **edit** | `filePath`, `oldString`, `newString`, `replaceAll?` | Exact-match string replacement with fuzzy fallback ladder (line-trimmed, block-anchored ≥0.65 similarity, whitespace-normalized, indentation-flexible, escape-normalized, trimmed-boundary, context-aware, multi-occurrence). Refuses spans much larger than `oldString`. Per-file locking, CRLF/BOM preserved. Collision notice when the file changed since read. Post-edit diagnostics appended. |
| **apply_patch** | `patchText` | `*** Begin/End Patch` with `Add/Delete/Update File` (+ `Move to`) sections. **Replaces edit/write on GPT-family models** (auto-detected). |

## Execution & search

| Tool | Params | Behavior & limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **bash** | `command`, `workdir?`, `timeout?` ms, `background?` | Default timeout 2 minutes (`PRIORICODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BASH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` overrides). Persistent shell per session. Output truncated at the same 2,000-line/50 KB wall — full text spilled to a file with the path given. `background: true` → job id + output file (see **jobs**). Tree-sitter parses file-touching args (`rm`, `mv`, `cp`…) for `external_directory` enforcement. Honors `bashSandbox` on macOS/Linux (never for pwsh/cmd). |
| **glob** | `pattern`, `path?` | ripgrep-powered file matching, 100 results. |
| **grep** | `pattern` (regex), `path?`, `include?` | ripgrep content search, 100 matches, grouped by file with line numbers. |
| **jobs** | `action: list\|output\|wait\|kill`, `id?`, `cursor?`, `timeout?` | Manage backgrounded shell jobs: incremental output via byte `cursor`, `wait` default 5 s (cap 600 s), kill for cleanup. Completion of a background job re-announces itself into the session. |

## Delegation & planning

| Tool | Params | Behavior & limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **task** | `description`, `prompt`, `subagent_type`, `task_id?` (resume), `background?` | Spawns a child session as that subagent; available types listed live in the tool description. `subagent_depth` default 1 caps recursion. Children get `todowrite`/`task` denied unless configured. `background` requires `PRIORICODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS`. |
| **todowrite** | `todos[] {content, status, priority}` | The visible plan tracker; exactly one `in_progress`, live updates. Statuses: `pending`/`in_progress`/`completed`/`cancelled`. |
| **question** | `questions[] {question, header ≤30 chars, options[], multiple?, custom?}` | Renders the tabbed picker UI; answers come back as label arrays. Gate: official clients or `PRIORICODE_ENABLE_QUESTION_TOOL`; `question` permission default-deny per agent. |
| **plan_enter** / **plan_exit** | none | Ask the user to switch build→plan / plan→build; approval injects the synthetic switch message. Defaults: denied except `build` may enter, `plan` may exit. |

## Knowledge & web

| Tool | Params | Behavior & limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **webfetch** | `url`, `format?` (`markdown`/`text`/`html`), `timeout?` s | 30 s default (max 120), 5 MB cap, HTTP→HTTPS upgrade, Cloudflare-challenge retry with its own UA, images returned as attachments. |
| **websearch** | `query`, `numResults?` (8), `livecrawl?`, `type?` (`auto/fast/deep`), `contextMaxCharacters?` (10,000) | Backends: Exa or Parallel over MCP; chosen by `PRIORICODE_WEBSEARCH_PROVIDER` / enable flags / deterministic session split. Gate: hosted PrioriCode provider or Exa/Parallel enabled. |
| **skill** | `name` | Loads a discovered skill's body into context (plus base dir + 10-file sample listing). Permission pattern = skill name. |
| **lsp** *(experimental)* | `operation`, `filePath`, `line`, `character`, `query?` | 9 navigation ops (definition, references, hover, symbols, implementation, call hierarchy). Gate: `PRIORICODE_EXPERIMENTAL_LSP_TOOL`. |
| **sessions** | `action: discover\|send\|ask\|respond\|wait\|notify\|claim\|release`, + per-action params | Cross-session coordination ([full page](../using/coordination.md)): ask timeout default 60 s/max 300 s; notify expiry 12 h; permission pattern = action name. |

## Conditional & special

| Tool | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **execute** *(code mode, experimental)* | One confined script that calls your MCP catalog as `server.tool(...)`; JSON values only at the boundary; direct MCP tools are replaced by this single entry when `PRIORICODE_EXPERIMENTAL_CODE_MODE` is on. Per-call permission checks still run. |
| **list\_mcp\_resources / list\_mcp\_resource\_templates / read\_mcp\_resource** | Exist only while a connected MCP server advertises resources; read permission is `mcp:<server>:<uri>`; binary attachments limited to pdf/gif/jpeg/png/webp ≤10 MB. |
| **invalid** | Internal placeholder for malformed model tool calls — never a capability, just how errors bounce back to the model. |

:::info
All tool output passes a shared truncation wall (defaults above): overflow is written to the tool-output directory and the path is given to the model, which can re-read it in slices. Nothing vanishes; only the context budget decides what stays visible.
