title: "Slash commands"
description: "Every slash command in the prioricode TUI with aliases — app, session, prompt-scope commands, built-in /init and /review, and custom command lookup."
---

Typed at the start of a prompt line, `/name args…`. Aliases route through the same autocomplete (`/mo` finds `/models` on purpose). Commands are grouped by where they live: app-level (work anywhere), session-level (need a session open), and prompt-level (shape the next message).

## App-level

| Command | Aliases | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/sessions` | `/resume`, `/continue` | session picker — resume, pin (`ctrl+f`), rename (`ctrl+r`), delete (`ctrl+d`) |
| `/new` | `/clear` | start a fresh session |
| `/models` | `/mo` | model picker |
| `/agents` | — | primary-agent picker |
| `/permission` | `/permissions` | session permission mode: default / ask-first / always-allow |
| `/variants` | — | model variant picker (hidden when the model has none) |
| `/mcps` | — | toggle MCP servers (space flips entries) |
| `/connect` | — | provider connection list |
| `/org` | `/orgs`, `/switch-org` | switch console org (shown with 2+ orgs) |
| `/workspaces` | — | *(experimental, flag-gated)* manage workspaces |
| `/status` | — | inventory: providers, MCP, LSP, formatters, plugins |
| `/coordination` | — | cross-session roster and inbox |
| `/settings` | — | settings UI (writes `tui.json`) |
| `/themes` | — | theme picker |
| `/debug` | — | debug info dialog |
| `/help` | — | keybinding help |
| `/exit` | `/quit`, `/q` | leave (also: bare `exit`, `quit`, or `:q` as the whole prompt) |

## Session-level

| Command | Aliases | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/share` | — | share/copy link (needs consent once; hidden if `share: disabled`) |
| `/unshare` | — | delete the share |
| `/rename` | — | retitle the session |
| `/timeline` | — | jump to any message |
| `/fork` | — | fork from a timeline message |
| `/compact` | `/summarize` | summarize history now |
| `/undo` | — | revert last user message (+ restore it into the prompt) |
| `/redo` | — | step reverts forward |
| `/timestamps` | `/toggle-timestamps` | show/hide message timestamps |
| `/thinking` | `/toggle-thinking` | cycle thinking-block visibility |
| `/copy` | — | transcript to clipboard |
| `/export` | — | transcript to file/editor (thinking, tool details, metadata toggles) |
| `/diff` | — | open the diff viewer |

## Prompt-level

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `/editor` | compose next message in `$EDITOR` (expands pasted-text parts, re-syncs attachments) |
| `/skills` | skill picker — inserts `/skill-name` into the prompt |
| `/warp` | *(experimental)* change the session's workspace |
| `/move` | relocate the session to another project directory |

## Built-ins (server-side prompt commands)

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `/init` | guided AGENTS.md setup — studies the project, writes the context file with you |
| `/review` | review changes (commit / branch / PR; default: uncommitted) — runs as a subtask |

Plus anything from your `command` config / `{command,commands}/*.md` files ([custom commands](../extending/commands.md)), skill names (see `/skills`), and remote MCP prompts surfaced as `/name:mcp`.

## Mini mode

`prioricode --mini` ships the minimal set: `/editor`, `/new`, `/exit`.
