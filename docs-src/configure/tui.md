description: "tui.json configuration — theme selection and custom themes, keybind overrides with leader-key syntax, attention sounds, cursor, scrolling, and diff style."
---

The interface half of configuration lives in its own file, `tui.json(c)` — discovered with the same walk-up-and-merge rules as [product config](files.md), but scoped so project settings and terminal aesthetics stay separate. (Old configs with `theme`/`keybinds` inside `prioricode.json` are migrated out automatically; they're stripped from the product config.)

```jsonc
// ~/.config/prioricode/tui.json — the global default; drop one in .prioricode/ per project
{
  "theme": "catppuccin",
  "keybinds": {
    "leader": "ctrl+space",
    "agent_cycle": "none",
    "session_compact": ["<leader>c", "<leader>k"]
  },
  "leader_timeout": 2000,
}
```

Settings changed through `/settings` and `/themes` write themselves back to the highest-precedence existing `tui.json`, or the global one — you don't have to hand-edit to customize.

## Themes

- `/themes` (`<leader>t`) lists everything, including a light/dark switch and a mode lock so a terminal theme flip doesn't drag your app theme with it.
- Built-ins cover the canon: catppuccin (×4 flavors), dracula, gruvbox, nord, tokyonight, one-dark, solarized, rosepine, matrix, monokai, nightowl, everforest, flexoki, kanagawa, aura, ayu, carbonfox, cobalt2, cursor, material, vercel, vesper, zenburn, palenight, mercury, osaka-jade, synthwave84, lucent-orng, orng, github — plus `prioricode`'s own amber identity and a `system` theme derived from your terminal palette.
- **Custom:** drop `themes/*.json` files into any config directory — `~/.config/prioricode/themes/` or `.prioricode/themes/` — and they join the picker. Theme plugins install into the same place, so "plugin theme" and "hand-written theme" are the same mechanism.

## Keybinds

Every binding is overridable by its **keybind id** (the full id→default table is in the [keybind reference](../reference/keybinds.md)). The grammar:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `"ctrl+p"` | Bind one chord |
| `"up,ctrl+p"` | Comma-separated: multiple chords for one command |
| `["<leader>m", "ctrl+m"]` | Array: same, as data |
| `{ "key": "ctrl+v", "preventDefault": false }` | Object form — also `event: "press"|"release"`, `fallthrough` |
| `"none"` or `false` | Unbind |
| `"<leader>…"` | The leader prefix expands to your leader key (default `ctrl+x`) |

Chords read left-to-right with `+` for modifiers (`shift+`, `ctrl+`, `alt+`, `super+`). `enter`/`esc`/`pgup`/`pgdown` are understood as aliases. An unrecognized keybind id is rejected loudly (`Unrecognized keybind…`) rather than silently ignored — typos don't hide here.

Two leader-key niceties:

- **`leader_timeout`** — window to complete a `<leader>` chord, default 2000 ms.
- **which-key panel** (`ctrl+alt+k`) — live overlay of valid next keys; it also explains what each chord does, which is how most people learn the set.

## Attention

Sounds and notifications for the moments you're not looking at the terminal:

```jsonc
{
  "attention": {
    "enabled": true,            // master switch (default: off)
    "notifications": true,      // desktop notifications
    "sound": true,
    "volume": 0.4,
    "sounds": {
      "question": "~/sounds/ask.wav",     // the agent needs an answer
      "permission": "~/sounds/ask.wav",   // a permission prompt is pending
      "error": "~/sounds/error.wav",
      "done": "~/sounds/done.wav",        // session went idle
      "subagent_done": "~/sounds/ding.wav"
    }
  }
}
```

Each slot accepts a custom audio file path; the default pack (`prioricode.default`) ships with the app. `enabled` stays off until you flip it — the terminal that pings only when you ask is the terminal you keep using.

## Interface odds and ends

| Key | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mouse` | `true` | Mouse selection/scroll in the TUI |
| `diff_style` | `"auto"` | `"stacked"` forces single-pane diffs on narrow terminals |
| `cursor.style` / `blinking` | terminal default | Block/underline/line in the prompt |
| `prompt.max_height` / `max_width` | adaptive | Cap the composer box |
| `scroll_speed`, `scroll_acceleration.enabled` | — | How the wheel feels |

:::info
`PRIORICODE_DISABLE_MOUSE=1` is there for terminal multiplexers that fight mouse capture; `PRIORICODE_DISABLE_TERMINAL_TITLE=1` for shells that hate title writes. Full list on the [environment reference](../reference/environment-variables.md).
