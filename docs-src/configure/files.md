description: "How prioricode discovers and merges config (prioricode.json/jsonc, .prioricode/, managed dirs), {env} and {file} substitution, data paths, and database routing."
---

PrioriCode reads your config the way git reads dotfiles: look everywhere in a defined order, merge deeply, last word wins. This page is the full discovery map — for the individual keys, see the [config reference](../reference/config.md).

## The files

| File | What it's for |
| --- | --- |
| `prioricode.json` / `prioricode.jsonc` | Product configuration (comments supported in `.jsonc`) |
| `tui.json` / `tui.jsonc` | Interface configuration — themes & keybinds ([next page](tui.md)) |
| `AGENTS.md` (+ `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`) | Project instructions ([context](../using/context.md)) |
| `.prioricode/{agents,commands,skills,tools,plugin,themes}/` | The extension folders ([extending](../extending/skills.md)) |
| `<data>/auth.json` | Stored provider credentials, mode `0600` |
| `<data>/prioricode*.db` | Sessions and state (SQLite) |

New config files are seeded with `"$schema": "https://prioricode.ai/config.json"` — that URL lights up autocomplete and validation in editors that support JSON Schema.

## Where it looks, in order

Priority runs bottom-up (later layers override earlier; deep-merged):

1. **Remote well-known configs** — any `providers login <url>` target contributes its advertised `config`.
2. **Global config dir** — `~/.config/prioricode` (XDG; `PRIORICODE_CONFIG_DIR` relocates it): `config.json` → `prioricode.json` → `prioricode.jsonc`.
3. `PRIORICODE_CONFIG` — one extra file, anywhere.
4. **Project files** — `prioricode.json(c)` walked from your cwd **up to the worktree root**; root-first, so the file closest to you has the highest say.
5. **Config directories** — the global dir, every `.prioricode/` between cwd and root, `~/.prioricode`, and `PRIORICODE_CONFIG_DIR`: each contributes config files, agents, commands, skills, tools, themes, and plugins.
6. `PRIORICODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` — inline JSON(C) as a final local layer. (Great for CI: no files on disk.)
7. **Console org config** — if you're logged into a PrioriCode org, its config is fetched and merged.
8. **Managed config** — `prioricode.json(c)` in the system dirs: `/Library/Application Support/prioricode` (macOS), `%ProgramData%\prioricode` (Windows), `/etc/prioricode` (Linux).
9. **macOS managed preferences** — the `ai.prioricode.managed` `.mobileconfig` domain. Overrules everything above.

Escape hatches: `PRIORICODE_DISABLE_PROJECT_CONFIG=1` skips project discovery entirely (repo can't configure your machine), and `--pure` skips external plugins.

`.prioricode/` gets bootstrapped politely: a `.gitignore` so local junk stays local, and `@prioricode/plugin` installed for file plugins and typed custom tools.

## Substitution

Any config text supports two templates:

```jsonc
{
  "model": "{env:PRIORICODE_MODEL}",
  "provider": {
    "acme": { "options": { "apiKey": "{file:./secrets/acme.key}" } }
  }
}
```

`{env:VAR}` pulls an environment variable; `{file:path}` reads a file (relative to the config file's directory, `~/` expanded). Secrets stay in files, patterns stay in git.

## Where PrioriCode puts its things

All XDG-standard, all overridable via the usual `XDG_*` env vars:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.local/share/prioricode` (data) | `prioricode.db`, `auth.json`, `mcp-auth.json`, `log/`, `plans/`, `tool-output/`, `repos/`, `snapshot/` |
| `~/.config/prioricode` (config) | global config dir (see above) |
| `~/.cache/prioricode` (cache) | cached model catalog, skill packs, `bin/` |
| `~/.local/state/prioricode` (state) | recently-used models, misc state |
| `$TMPDIR/prioricode` (tmp) | scratch |

Print the truth for your machine with `prioricode debug paths`, and `prioricode db path` for the database specifically.

### Which database, exactly

| Your build's channel | DB file (under data dir) |
| --- | --- |
| `latest`, `beta`, `prod`, or running from source (`local`) | `prioricode.db` — shared, so sessions/projects/coordination carry across |
| any other channel (e.g. a desktop `dev` build) | `prioricode-<channel>.db` — deliberately isolated |
| `PRIORICODE_DISABLE_CHANNEL_DB=1` | forces `prioricode.db` |
| `PRIORICODE_DB=/some/path` | that path, full stop (`:memory:` works too) |

:::warning
Two processes with *different* DB files will cheerfully not coordinate — that's the #1 "why don't my sessions see each other?" cause. Run `prioricode db path` in each process when [coordination](../using/coordination.md) looks deaf. And `PRIORICODE_DB` is a sledgehammer: it relocates *all* state, including credentials' neighborhood.

## Effective-config debugging

```bash
prioricode debug config     # the merged result, what the app actually sees
```

Precedence fights are resolved by inspection, not archaeology.
