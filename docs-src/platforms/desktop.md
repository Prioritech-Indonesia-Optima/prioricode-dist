description: "The PrioriCode desktop app — an Electron shell around the full agent: channels, sidecar server, auto-update, WSL, and how it stores state."

The desktop app puts the same engine behind window chrome: the web interface rendered in Electron, with a PrioriCode server process living next door. It's the phone-in-your-pocket of PrioriCode surfaces — one install, sessions everywhere.

:::info
Availability first: desktop builds are wired into the release pipeline but, as of this writing, release pages ship CLI binaries — the desktop app is marked *coming soon* in the project README. Check the [releases page](https://github.com/Prioritech-Indonesia-Optima/prioricode/releases) for `prioricode-desktop-…` artifacts; when they appear, this is what you're installing.

## What it actually is

- **Electron** shell rendering the same SolidJS app UI as `prioricode web` — sessions, prompts, settings — with native niceties: custom title bar (traffic lights on macOS, frameless-with-overlay on Windows), context menus, first-run onboarding, and a localized interface.
- **Sidecar server**: a real `prioricode` server process launched per window-session, with the embedded web UI disabled (the Electron renderer *is* the UI). Tools run locally, exactly as the CLI would.
- **Deep link**: `prioricode://` URLs can hand work to the app.

## Channels: dev, beta, prod

Three identities side-by-side on one machine:

| Channel | App name | Bundle id | Database |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prod | PrioriCode | `ai.prioricode.desktop` | shared `prioricode.db` |
| beta | PrioriCode Beta | `ai.prioricode.desktop.beta` | shared `prioricode.db` |
| dev | PrioriCode Dev | `ai.prioricode.desktop.dev` | separate `prioricode-dev.db` |

That last row is the interesting one: production and beta desktop builds share the CLI's database — sessions, projects, and coordination state carry between surfaces — while the dev channel is sandboxed to its own DB by design (see [config files](../configure/files.md) for the routing table).

## Updates

Auto-update is packaged-only and dialog-driven: it notifies, you decide, download follows your choice. Beta/dev builds point at their own update feeds. If the app ever goes unresponsive there's a recovery flow with log export — no hunting for the log dir yourself.

## Windows + WSL

On Windows the app can host sessions inside WSL distros: install the CLI within the distro (the installer one-liner) and the desktop app drives servers there, with the same attach-style connection as any remote server.

## Relationship to `prioricode web`

Same UI, different transport. The desktop wraps the app in Electron and talks to its own sidecar; `prioricode web` serves the same bundle over HTTP from a CLI machine. If you want sessions reachable from a phone or another computer, run the **server**, not the desktop.
