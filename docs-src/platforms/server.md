title: "Server & remote"
description: "prioricode serve, web, and attach — running the agent as an HTTP server, the browser UI, basic auth, mDNS discovery, and the event stream."
---

The TUI is a client. Underneath, PrioriCode is a session server with a nice face. That means you can run it headless, serve the browser UI from it, drive it from another machine, or skip the face entirely and script it.

## Three commands, one server

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `prioricode serve` | Headless HTTP server. No UI, just the API. |
| `prioricode web` | Server **plus** the embedded browser UI; prints the URL and opens your browser. |
| `prioricode attach <url>` | Point a local TUI at an already-running server. Rendering here, execution there. |

`serve` and `web` share the same network options (and the `server` block in `prioricode.json`):

```bash
prioricode web --port 4096 --hostname 0.0.0.0 \
  --mdns --mdns-domain prioricode.local \
  --cors https://myapp.example
```

| Flag | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--port` | `0` (random) | Pin it for firewall/SSH plans; the TUI picks its own port automatically. |
| `--hostname` | `127.0.0.1` | Loopback by default. `0.0.0.0` to expose — with intent, not by accident. |
| `--mdns` | `false` | Advertises the server on the local network (forces `0.0.0.0`). |
| `--mdns-domain` | `prioricode.local` | The name peers discover you under. |
| `--cors` | none | Extra origins allowed to hit the API from browsers. |

## The web interface

`prioricode web` serves the full app UI (the same SolidJS interface as the desktop app): session home, active sessions, project folders, settings for servers/providers/keybinds. Bind `--hostname 0.0.0.0` and browse from any device on the network — or SSH-port-forward and pretend it's local, which is nicer for the firewall.

If the embedded UI is disabled (`PRIORICODE_DISABLE_EMBEDDED_WEB_UI=1` — what the desktop app does for its sidecar server), the routes proxy to the hosted app instead.

## Authenticating (don't skip this)

:::warning
A server with no password is a server with no login. `serve`/`web` say it out loud at startup: *"PRIORICODE_SERVER_PASSWORD is not set; server is unsecured."* On loopback that's defensible; on `0.0.0.0` it is a data leak with a friendly face.
:::

```bash
export PRIORICODE_SERVER_PASSWORD='pick-a-real-one'
prioricode serve                      # username defaults to `prioricode` / PRIORICODE_SERVER_USERNAME

prioricode attach http://box:4096 \
  --username alice --password "$PW"   # or env vars; defaults apply
```

Basic auth covers every client: attach, `run --attach`, the SDK, the web UI. The server itself is opt-in infrastructure — securing it is documented as the user's responsibility in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/Prioritech-Indonesia-Optima/prioricode/blob/main/SECURITY.md), and the defaults respect that: loopback only, no password implied, loud warnings emitted.

## Under the hood: one API, many clients

The server speaks a documented HTTP API — the full interactive surface: sessions, prompts, permissions, questions, providers, MCP auth, files, TUI control (every route is enumerated in the OpenAPI spec). Two event streams keep clients live:

- `GET /global/event` — the firehose every official client (TUI, web, attach) subscribes to.
- `GET /api/session/{sessionID}/event` — scoped to one session, for your own dashboards.

Everything else is exactly what the TUI calls, so anything the interface can do is scriptable. The TypeScript SDK is the typed wrapper: see the [SDK page](../sdk.md) and the OpenAPI spec it is generated from.

```bash
# a session, via plain curl, with auth
curl -u "prioricode:$PRIORICODE_SERVER_PASSWORD" \
  -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4096/session \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

Permissions and questions that surface on the server reply through `POST /permission/{requestID}/reply` and `/question/{requestID}/reply` — that's how a scripted client becomes the human: intercept an ask, decide, answer.

## Slack, for the social kind of automation

`packages/slack` ships a small bot ([@prioricode/slack](https://github.com/Prioritech-Indonesia-Optima/prioricode/tree/main/packages/slack)): mention it in a channel, and it boots an in-process PrioriCode server, keeps one session per thread, and posts tool activity back into the conversation. Setup is classic Slack-app: create an app with Socket Mode, scopes `chat:write`, `app_mentions:read`, `channels:history`, `groups:history`; then run it with `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` set. It's a package in the repo rather than a hosted integration — bring your own runner.

:::info
The Slack bot is a thin example of what the API enables, not a supported product surface. Treat it as reference code you deploy — review it before pointing it at production channels.
