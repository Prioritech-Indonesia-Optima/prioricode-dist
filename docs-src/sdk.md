description: "The @prioricode/sdk typed client — sessions, prompts, file attachments, event streams, and answering permission requests from code."
---

The SDK is the typed door to everything the TUI does: the client is generated from the server's OpenAPI spec, so requests, responses, and events are all real types — no guessing payloads.

## Install & talk to a server

```bash
npm install @prioricode/sdk
```

```bash
prioricode serve --port 4096      # export PRIORICODE_SERVER_PASSWORD if it's not loopback-only
```

```ts
import { createPrioricodeClient } from "@prioricode/sdk"

const client = createPrioricodeClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:4096",
  directory: process.cwd(), // project scoping: sent as a header/query, honored on reads
})
```

If your server has a password (it should, off-loopback), requests need HTTP Basic like any other client (`attach` uses `-u/-p`; the SDK config accepts the same credentials via its request options). Loopback servers accept unauthenticated requests — same security story as [server & remote](platforms/server.md).

Prefer the SDK to own the whole lifecycle? `createPrioricode()` boots a local server process (`prioricode serve` under the hood, default `127.0.0.1:4096`, options for `hostname`/`port`) and hands you a connected client — one call, disposable agent.

## Sessions and prompts

```ts
const session = await client.session.create()

await client.session.prompt({
  path: { id: session.data.id },
  body: {
    parts: [
      { type: "text", text: "Write tests for every public function in this file." },
      { type: "file", mime: "text/plain", url: "file:///abs/path/to/src/core.ts" },
    ],
  },
})
```

Parts are the vocabulary of prompts: text, files (data-URLs or `file://` URLs, images included), and anything else the API defines. The same `prompt` body powers `--continue`, agents, models:

```ts
await client.session.prompt({
  path: { id: session.data.id },
  body: { parts: [{ type: "text", text: "…" }], model: { providerID: "anthropic", modelID: "claude-sonnet-4-5" }, agent: "plan" },
})
```

The full request/response surface — `session.list`, messages, revert, fork, share (`POST`/`DELETE /session/{id}/share`), MCP, providers, TUI control — is defined by the OpenAPI spec served at [`/openapi.json`](/openapi.json); docs hosts that support it render that spec as an interactive playground.

## Listening: the event stream

```ts
const events = await client.event.subscribe()

for await (const event of events.stream) {
  if (event.type === "message.updated") {
    // event.properties.info.role, .agent, .modelID …
  }
}
```

Event types are the same bus the TUI renders from — `session.created`/`updated`/`deleted`, `message.updated`, `message.part.updated`, permission and question requests, provider and catalog changes. This is how a headless client becomes interactive.

## Being the human, programmatically

Two routes are where "unattended" gets judged:

```ts
// Answer a permission request (same semantics as the TUI panel)
await client.postSessionIdPermissionsPermissionId({
  path: { sessionID: id, permissionID: permission.id },
  body: { response: "once" }, // "once" | "always" | "reject"
})
```

Questions from the `question` tool reply through `POST /question/{requestID}/reply` — body `{ answers: [["selected label", …]] }`, one array per question — or via the `/api/session/...` family on the `@prioricode/sdk/v2` client, which namespaces `session`, `permission`, and `question` with typed helpers. Both shapes are fully described in the interactive [API reference](sdk.md) below.

That's the entire contract for policy engines: subscribe, evaluate the ask against *your* rules (CMDB, ownership, blast radius), reply. The agent blocks until you do — an approve-gate you can audit.

## Patterns worth stealing

- **Fan-out CI jobs**: one `createPrioricode()` per shard, `Promise.all` over `session.prompt` (the repo's own SDK example processes files this way) — then harvest transcripts with `session.get`/parts or share them.
- **Approval bot**: subscribe to events, forward `permission.*` asks into Slack, reply from the button press.
- **Fleet runner**: `run --attach` is this SDK from a CLI; anything it can do, your binary can.

## Reference

- [OpenAPI specification](/openapi.json) — Every endpoint with typed request/response schemas — machine-readable, the same document the playground and SDK are generated from.

:::info
The spec at `packages/sdk/openapi.json` is generated — after HttpApi route changes, regenerate with `bun run build` in `packages/sdk/js` (repo convention). Docs never hand-copy endpoint tables; they link to the spec.
  npm availability note: like the CLI, `@prioricode/sdk` publishes when registry credentials are configured; if npm 404s, vendor it from the repo.
