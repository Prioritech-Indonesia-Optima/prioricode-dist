description: "How PrioriCode documentation maps to releases: living docs on the latest line, versioned snapshots per release line, and how to tell what your build matches."
---

Short answer: **the docs you're reading track the latest release of PrioriCode, always.** The version selector in the header exists for when you're stuck on an older line — or need to check what changed between lines.

## The model

PrioriCode ships small and often: every release is a **+1 patch** (`v0.1.11 → v0.1.12 → …`), cut automatically when verified work lands on `main`. Documentation follows a matching discipline:

| Thing | Where it lives | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **These docs** | This site (`packages/docs`) | Updated in the *same commit* as the change they describe — feature, flag, default, all of it. |
| **Release notes** | [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Prioritech-Indonesia-Optima/prioricode/releases) | Generated per release: the raw list of what shipped, newest first. |
| **Versioned doc lines** | The docs version selector | One entry per **minor release line** (`v0.1`, later `v0.2`, `v1.0`). Snapshots of the whole site at the moment a line ends. |

Patch releases don't get their own docs version — a dropdown with forty near-identical entries isn't granularity, it's noise. The living docs *are* the patch history, kept honest by the same-commit rule.

## Am I reading the right docs for my build?

Check your build:

```bash
prioricode --version
```

Compare against the latest release on GitHub (or let the updater tell you — it pings within seconds of launching when something newer exists). If your build is older than the docs you're quoting:

```bash
prioricode upgrade          # or: prioricode upgrade <target>
```

Rules of thumb:

- **Something in the docs doesn't exist in your build** → you're behind, or the feature is experimental (those pages say so loudly, flag included).
- **Your build does something the docs don't mention** → that's a docs bug. We hold this repo to the same-commit rule; open an issue and it counts.
- **You're pinned to an old release line on purpose** → pick it from the docs version selector (where multiple lines are published); the snapshot from the end of that line is what you'll read.

## How a line gets archived

When `v0.1.x` ends and a new line (`v0.2`) begins:

1. The current docs tree is copied into a version folder (`v0.1/`) in the docs source.
2. A `v0.1` entry joins the version selector pointing at that snapshot, no longer `default`.
3. Root docs continue as the living `v0.2` line.

Nothing in a snapshot is edited afterward; corrections happen on the living line. That way "what did the docs say back then" stays answerable, and "what is true now" stays single-sourced.

Release lines move when *you* decide they should: patch is automatic, minor/major bumps are explicitly requested in this project's publish pipeline. The docs switcher follows the same rule.
