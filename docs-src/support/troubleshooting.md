description: "Diagnosing PrioriCode problems — debug commands, logs and log levels, status dialogs, common failures, and how to report an issue usefully."
---

When the agent misbehaves, don't guess. `prioricode` carries its own diagnostic suite; this page is the map.

## First look: /status and /debug

Inside the TUI:

- **`/status`** (`<leader>s`) — what PrioriCode actually sees: connected providers, MCP servers, LSP servers, formatters, plugins. Half of "why isn't X working" is answered here.
- **`/debug`** — version, OS, terminal, and runtime internals, formatted for bug reports.
- **`/coordination`** — if sessions aren't seeing each other, the roster shows what each process believes (§ below).

## From the CLI: `prioricode debug`

```bash
prioricode debug info           # version/OS/terminal/plugins — paste this in issues
prioricode debug paths          # every directory PrioriCode uses (data/config/cache/state/log)
prioricode debug config         # the effective merged configuration
prioricode debug agent build    # how an agent resolved: model, permissions, prompt
prioricode debug lsp            # LSP server inventory; also: diagnostics <file>, symbols <query>
prioricode debug file read <p>  # how the read tool sees a file (truncation, encoding)
prioricode debug ripgrep        # is bundled ripgrep functioning?
prioricode debug startup        # where boot time is going
prioricode debug snapshot track # file-snapshot state (undo/revert depends on this)
```

## Turning up the lights

```bash
prioricode --print-logs --log-level DEBUG
```

- `--print-logs` mirrors the logger to stderr (env: `PRIORICODE_PRINT_LOGS=1`).
- `--log-level DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR` — or set it persistently in `prioricode.json` (`logLevel`).
- Logs also land on disk: `prioricode debug paths` prints the log directory (`<data>/log`).
- To rule out third-party plugins interfering: `prioricode --pure` runs with only built-ins (env equivalent `PRIORICODE_PURE=1`).
- Suspect your config? `PRIORICODE_DISABLE_PROJECT_CONFIG=1` ignores `.prioricode` project files; run again, compare.

## Common failures, decoded

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "No model selected" / nothing responds | No provider connected | `prioricode providers login` or export an API key; check `/status` |
| `providers login` lists few providers | Catalog couldn't be fetched | `prioricode models --refresh`; offline, config-declared providers still work |
| Model works but costs/context look wrong | Model not in catalog / missing `limit` | Declare the model under `provider.<id>.models` with real `limit.context` |
| `warning: PRIORICODE_SERVER_PASSWORD is not set; server is unsecured` | Server started without auth | Set the env var before `serve`/`web`; loopback-only if you don't need remote |
| 401 on `attach`/SDK calls | Password/username mismatch | Basic auth defaults to user `prioricode`; pass `-u/-p` explicitly |
| MCP server "needs\_auth" | Remote server wants OAuth | `prioricode mcp auth <name>`; `prioricode mcp debug <name>` probes discovery |
| MCP server "failed" | Command not on PATH / wrong args | `prioricode mcp list` shows status; test the `command` array in a bare shell first |
| Edits fail with "oldString not found" repeatedly | File changed since read | Have the agent re-read before editing; check a formatter isn't rewriting on save (`formatter: false` to bisect) |
| Bash exits nonzero with "may be sandbox denials" | `bashSandbox` blocked it | Add to `bashSandbox.writablePaths` or set `network: "allow"` — don't disable the sandbox reflexively |
| Tool output cut off | Truncation (by design) | Full output path is printed; tune `tool_output.max_lines`/`max_bytes` |
| "Permission required" storms on every step | `ask-first` mode or deny-heavy rules | `/permission` to check session mode; review `permission` rules — last match wins |
| Escape doesn't interrupt | First Escape only arms it | Press twice within 5 s (the footer tells you) |
| Sessions don't coordinate across instances | Different DB files | `prioricode db path` in each process must match; check channel/`PRIORICODE_DB` ([versioning page](versions.md) has the routing table) |
| Undo/revert won't restore files | Snapshots off | `snapshot: true` (default) — someone set it false |
| Clipboard paste does nothing on Linux | No clipboard helper | Re-run the installer (it installs one), or `PRIORICODE_NO_CLIPBOARD=1` and attach files manually |
| `!` shell commands find different tools than your terminal | Shell resolution | PrioriCode uses config `shell` else `$SHELL`; Windows also honors `PRIORICODE_GIT_BASH_PATH` |

## The database, when you must look

```bash
prioricode db path                      # which file
prioricode db                           # sqlite3 shell (if installed)
prioricode db "select * from session limit 5" --format json
```

Read-only spelunking is safe; **editing** session rows while a process is running is how databases teach lessons. Stop PrioriCode first if you must write.

## Privacy & security posture

- Your code stays local: processing happens on your machine or through direct calls to your chosen AI provider. PrioriCode collects no default telemetry — [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/Prioritech-Indonesia-Optima/prioricode/blob/main/SECURITY.md) is the threat model, and the OpenTelemetry integration (`experimental.openTelemetry`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` env) is opt-in plumbing for *your* observability stack.
- Exceptions to "stays local": sharing (`/share`, `"share": "disabled"` to remove it) and whatever your MCP servers/provider APIs do — you choose those, so choose knowing.
- The permission system is UX, not a jail. Need real isolation: container or VM. The page for that posture is [permissions](../using/permissions.md).

## Reporting an issue usefully

Attach: `prioricode debug info` output, `--log-level DEBUG` stderr from a reproduction, the session export (sanitized: `prioricode export --sanitize`), and exact config keys that differ from default. File at [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Prioritech-Indonesia-Optima/prioricode/issues); security findings via GitHub Security Advisories — and per repo policy, security reports must be human-written (AI-generated ones are auto-closed).
