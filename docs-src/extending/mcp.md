MCP is the USB-C of agent tooling: any server that speaks it hands PrioriCode extra tools — databases, browsers, design systems, internal APIs. This page is the whole wiring diagram.

## Adding one

The wizard knows the shapes:

```bash
prioricode mcp add linear --url https://mcp.linear.app/sse --header "X-Team=platform"
prioricode mcp add fs -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path
```

Ask for it interactively (`prioricode mcp add`) and it walks you through project-vs-global scope (project = your `.prioricode/prioricode.json`, global = your config file — edits preserve comments) and local-vs-remote, with optional OAuth client credentials.

Or write the config directly — `mcp` maps a name to a local or remote definition:

```jsonc
{
  "mcp": {
    "playwright": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "@playwright/mcp"],
      "environment": { "BROWSER": "chromium" },
      "cwd": ".",
      "timeout": 20000
    },
    "linear": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/sse",
      "headers": { "X-Team": "platform" },
      "oauth": { "scope": "read write" },
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

- **Local** servers spawn from the `command` array (argv; no shell), stdio transport, with `environment` merged over your process env.
- **Remote** servers are tried as **Streamable HTTP first, then SSE** — you don't pick; both are spoken.
- `enabled: false` keeps the definition but stays disconnected; a shorthand `{ "enabled": true }` entry can toggle a server defined in another file.

## Managing them

```bash
prioricode mcp list                     # status per server: connected, disabled, needs_auth, failed…
prioricode mcp auth [name]              # run the OAuth flow (browser or paste-code)
prioricode mcp auth list                # which servers hold tokens
prioricode mcp logout <name>            # forget tokens
prioricode mcp debug <name>             # probe a remote: discovery, client registration, token state
```

In the TUI, `/mcps` is the live toggle board (`space` flips servers without editing JSON), and `/status` shows what's actually connected.

## OAuth, for the remote ones

Remote servers that want auth are auto-detected (unless you set `"oauth": false`). PrioriCode does the full dance — authorization-server discovery, **dynamic client registration** when no `clientId` is configured, browser consent, then a loopback callback to `http://127.0.0.1:19876/mcp/oauth/callback` (both port and redirect are overridable). Tokens + client registrations persist in `<data>/mcp-auth.json` and refresh quietly. If registration is required before auth can work, the status says `needs_client_registration` instead of failing silently.

## What the agent actually sees

- **Tools:** each server tool is exposed as `<server>_<tool>` (non-alphanumerics folded into `_`). That name is also its permission key — `playwright_navigate: allow` works like any other [tool permission](../using/permissions.md).
- **Resources:** a server advertising resources gets three meta-tools — `list_mcp_resources`, `list_mcp_resource_templates`, `read_mcp_resource` — with `mcp:<server>:<uri>` permission patterns. Images and PDFs read through them arrive as attachments.
- **Prompts:** exposed as `/name:mcp` slash commands.
- **Liveness:** tool lists refresh when a server sends `changes`, without a restart.

Server info gets a roots handshake too: PrioriCode advertises your project directory, so well-behaved servers scope their own file access to it.

## Timeouts

Three places to tune, in resolution order: live `mcp.<name>.timeout`, static config timeout, and the `experimental.mcp_timeout` catch-all. Remote connection and tool-listing have their own generous defaults; local stdio init is the one people notice on slow machines — set `timeout` explicitly for anything you start cold.

:::info
A misbehaving server is quarantined, not trusted: connect/list failures surface in `mcp list` status and `/status`, and calls fail with the server named. You're never silently downgraded to half a toolset.

## Code mode (experimental)

With `PRIORICODE_EXPERIMENTAL_CODE_MODE=1`, individual MCP tools stop appearing as separate tools. Instead the agent gets one `execute` tool for writing a small confined script that calls your MCP catalog programmatically (`server.tool(...)` with JSON values) — batching fan-out work without a model round-trip per call. Each embedded call still passes permission checks and hooks. Off by default; the catalog is MCP-specific and may change shape between releases.
