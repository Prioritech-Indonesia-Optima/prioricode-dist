title: "Custom file tools"
description: "Drop a .js/.ts file in {tool,tools}/ to add a tool to prioricode — description, args (Zod or JSON Schema), execute, permissions, and attachments."
---

The smallest extensibility unit that exists: one file, one tool. No package, no plugin declaration — PrioriCode scans your config directories and the tool appears.

## The file

`<config-dir>/tool/weather.ts` (or `tools/`; either project `.prioricode/` or global config):

```ts
import { z } from "zod"

export default {
  description: "Current temperature for a city",
  args: {
    city: z.string().describe("City name"),
  },
  async execute(args, ctx) {
    const res = await fetch(`https://wttr.in/${encodeURIComponent(args.city)}?format=3`)
    const text = await res.text()
    return { title: args.city, output: text, metadata: { source: "wttr.in" } }
  },
}
```

The tool is named after the file (`weather`); additional named exports register as `weather_<export>`, so one file can ship a family of related tools. TypeScript runs through the same loader as everything else — dependencies resolve from the config directory's package context, so run `bun i` next to your tool files when you need libraries.

## The contract

- **`args`** — either a Zod shape (preferred; `describe()` lands in the model's schema) or plain JSON-Schema property objects (legacy: every declared property becomes required).
- **`execute(args, ctx)`** — returns a string, or `{ title?, output, metadata?, attachments? }`. `output` is what the model reads; `title` is the row in the TUI; `metadata` survives into the session for later tools; `attachments` accepts image/file payloads the model can actually see.
- **`ctx`** gives you `sessionID`, `messageID`, the current `agent`, the `directory`/`worktree`, an `abort` signal (user hit escape-twice), a `metadata()` setter for live progress while you work, and `ask()` to request a permission from inside.

## Permissions, naturally

The tool's name is its permission key. It asks before running (default `ask`), and your rules treat it like any built-in:

```jsonc
{ "permission": { "weather": "allow" } }
```

That's not a formality: your `execute` runs with your process's full privileges. Whatever you would guard in a shell script — paths, tokens, destructive verbs — guard here too.

## When to use this instead of…

| Better tool | When |
| --- | --- |
| **File tool (this)** | A single callable action; a weekend of glue; prototyping a capability. |
| [Plugin](plugins.md) | Several tools, events, transforms, auth, or anything you'll publish. |
| [MCP](mcp.md) | The capability should be shared across agent products, over a protocol, or in another language. |
| [Custom command](commands.md) | The "capability" is really a better prompt, not code. |
