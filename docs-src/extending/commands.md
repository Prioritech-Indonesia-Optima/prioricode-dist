title: "Custom slash commands"
description: "Markdown commands for prioricode's slash palette — arguments ($1, $ARGUMENTS), embedded shell output, per-command model and agent, built-in /init and /review."
---

You type `/deploy staging`. PrioriCode expands a markdown template — with arguments slotted in and live shell output baked in — and sends it as a prompt. Custom commands are prompt macros: your team's repeated asks, named.

## The file

Drop markdown into `.prioricode/commands/` (project) or `~/.config/prioricode/commands/` (global) — both `command/` and `commands/` work, subfolders are fine, and the path becomes the command name (`git/commit.md` → `/commit` from that folder's scan root).

```markdown
---
description: Summarize a branch's changes against main
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
agent: plan
---

Summarize what `$1` changes relative to `main`.

Current diff stat:
!`git diff main...$1 --stat`

Cover: features added, risks, and anything that looks accidentally included.
```

`/branch-summary feature/auth` then arrives as a fully-realized prompt.

## Arguments

| Pattern | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `$1`, `$2`, … | Positional arguments, split on whitespace (quote with `"…"`/`'…'` to group). The **highest-numbered** placeholder swallows the rest — `$3` in a two-`$` template gets everything after arg 2. |
| `$ARGUMENTS` | The raw argument string, verbatim. |
| *(neither present)* | Your arguments are appended after the template, separated by a blank line. |

The palette shows the placeholders each command expects (they're harvested from the template), so `/deploy` tells you it wants `$1 $2` before you guess.

## ``!`shell` `` interpolation

Backtick expressions of the form ``!`command` `` run **before** the prompt is sent, and their stdout replaces them — the model sees the output, not the command. It's the difference between "check the test failures" and a prompt that already contains them:

```markdown
---
description: Triage the latest failing tests
---
Here's what broke:
!`bun test 2>&1 | tail -50`

Rank by severity and start with any that touch `src/billing/`.
```

Shell commands run in your config `shell` (or `$SHELL`). This is prompt-time execution, so: keep it deterministic, keep it fast, and never write secrets into the output you're pasting into a session.

## Frontmatter fields

| Key | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `description` | Shown in autocomplete |
| `agent` | Run as this agent (its model/permissions apply) |
| `model` | Override model for this command, `provider/model` |
| `variant` | Model variant (reasoning effort) |
| `subtask` | `true` → dispatch as a subagent task instead of steering the session |

## From the CLI

Commands are first-class in headless mode:

```bash
prioricode run --command branch-summary feature/auth -- "extra, quoted args work too"
```

That's what makes them CI-legitimate: a reviewed, versioned prompt template with argument hygiene, callable from a pipeline.

## Built right alongside your own

Two ship with the binary:

- **`/init`** — guided `AGENTS.md` setup: PrioriCode studies the project and walks you into a good context file. The fastest way to bootstrap [project context](../using/context.md).
- **`/review`** — review changes (commit, branch, or PR; defaults to uncommitted) as a subtask.

[Skills](skills.md) also surface as commands, and remote MCP servers expose their prompts as `/name:mcp` entries — autocomplete labels the difference.
