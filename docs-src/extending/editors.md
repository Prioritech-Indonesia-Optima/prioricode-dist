---

PrioriCode is happiest in a terminal — including the terminal *docked in your IDE*. But it also speaks two protocols that put it natively inside editors: ACP, and plain `$EDITOR` handoffs.

## The terminal is the integration

Run `prioricode` in VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, or any IDE's integrated terminal and two things happen: PrioriCode detects the environment (the `TERM_PROGRAM`/`PRIORICODE_CALLER` handshake), and the companion extension can auto-install for tighter wiring.

**The VS Code companion** (published as "PrioriCode" on the VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX) adds:

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Esc` | Open a PrioriCode terminal (focused / new) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Option+K` | Insert the current file — with a line range, `@File#L37-42` — into the agent's prompt |

It's context-aware: your selection and active file travel with the reference. If auto-install is restricted in your setup (enterprise policy, airgapped), grab `prioricode.vsix` from the releases and install manually.

## ACP: PrioriCode as an editor-native agent

```bash
prioricode acp
```

That starts the **Agent Client Protocol** server over stdio (JSON-RPC, newline-delimited) — full agent inside the editor's own UI: sessions, tool renders, permission prompts, streamed updates, even usage/token counts. It's not a bridge to the TUI; it's a second face on the same server (which it spawns locally — network flags and `--cwd` apply).

Register it wherever ACP is supported:

#### Zed

```json title="~/.config/zed/settings.json"
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "PrioriCode": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "prioricode",
      "args": ["acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Open with the `agent: new thread` action. Zed's ACP registry may also offer a one-click entry when PrioriCode is listed there — same engine either way.

#### JetBrains

ACP support lands in recent JetBrains IDEs via an `acp.json` agent definition pointing at the same `prioricode acp` command — see the ACP docs for your IDE build.

#### Neovim

Plugins that speak ACP — `avante.nvim`, `CodeCompanion.nvim` — accept a `prioricode` agent config the same way; both take the `{ command = "prioricode", args = { "acp" } }` shape.

Feature parity through ACP: built-in tools, custom tools/commands, MCP servers, `AGENTS.md` rules, formatters/LSP, and agents-with-permissions all apply — it's the same engine. One known gap: `/undo`/`/redo` (transcript time travel) isn't surfaced through the protocol.

## `$EDITOR`, properly

- **`/editor`** (or `<leader>e`) opens your `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` to compose the next prompt — multi-prompt-in-one-file territory. `EDITOR="code --wait"` works exactly like you'd expect.
- **`/export`** pipes a transcript through the editor too, with toggles for thinking blocks, tool details, and metadata before the file lands.
- **Zed selection context:** run the TUI with Zed open and it can pick up your current selection as attached context on submit (`clear` it via the editor-context command if it's not what you meant).

## Which do I want?

| Situation | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Live in a terminal already; want zero protocol | Integrated terminal + the VS Code extension |
| Want the agent inside the editor's UI chrome | ACP (`prioricode acp`) |
| Just need to compose a long prompt | `/editor` / `<leader>e` |
| Neovim without ACP plugins | Terminal is genuinely the integration |
