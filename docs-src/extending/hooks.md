Hooks are your scripts in the agent's loop. Five lifecycle events, plain shell commands, JSON on stdin — and one exit code that means *no*. No dependencies, no build step; if it runs in your terminal it runs as a hook.

## Configuration

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "bash",          // wildcard over tool name; omit to match all
        "command": "./.prioricode/hooks/block-push.sh",
        "timeout": 10               // seconds; default 30
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [{ "command": "jq -r '.tool_response' >> /tmp/agent-audit.log", "matcher": "edit" }],
    "SessionStart": [{ "command": "echo branch=$(git branch --show-current)" }],
    "Stop": [{ "command": "afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff" }],
    "Notification": [{ "command": "curl -s -X POST https://ntfy.example.com/room -d \"$1\"" }]
  }
}
```

| Event | Fires | Can it stop things? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PreToolUse` | Before every tool call | **Yes** — exit code **2** blocks the call; stderr is handed to the model as the reason. |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool call completes | No — observe/log only. |
| `SessionStart` | A new root session begins | No. |
| `Stop` | A root session goes idle | No — "it's done" ping. |
| `Notification` | Something needs you (permission decision, session error) | No — route the alert somewhere you'll see it. |

Hook lists from multiple config files concatenate (deduped by command), so a project ships its guards and your global config adds personal ones.

## The stdin contract

Every hook receives one JSON object on stdin:

```json
{ "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse", "session_id": "ses_…", "cwd": "/work/repo", "tool_name": "bash", "tool_input": { "command": "git push" }, "tool_response": null }
```

`tool_input` is the pending arguments; `tool_response` populates for `PostToolUse`. That's the whole interface — parse with `jq`, grep it, decide, exit.

Blocking example (`block-push.sh`):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
input=$(cat)
cmd=$(jq -r '.tool_input.command // ""' <<<"$input")
if [[ "$cmd" == git\ push* ]]; then
  echo "pushes are human-only from CI contexts" >&2
  exit 2
fi
exit 0
```

The model doesn't fail silently — it gets `Tool call blocked by a PreToolUse hook: pushes are human-only…` and adapts.

## Ground rules the runtime enforces

- **Timeout** per hook (seconds), default 30 s — a hung hook doesn't hang the agent, it's terminated and logged.
- **Output caps** at 64 KB each of stdout/stderr.
- **Environment scrubbing:** hooks get a safe subset (`PATH`, `HOME`, `SHELL`, `TERM`, locale, `TMPDIR`, `XDG_*`…) — anything that smells like `API_KEY`/`TOKEN`/`SECRET`/`PASSWORD` is stripped before your script runs. Keep your secrets out of hook stdout anyway.
- **Recursion guard:** hooks can't spawn hook-evaluated tool loops (`PRIORICODE_HOOK_DEPTH` tracks nesting).
- **Failures are loud where they matter:** a non-blocking hook erroring is logged and published as a hook-failed event; only `PreToolUse` exit-2 has teeth.

:::tip
Hooks are for guardrails and glue — lint after edit, log every shell command, ping your phone when a long run finishes. For anything that needs to *change* the tool call, rewrite the prompt, or add a provider, that's [plugins](plugins.md), which sit on the in-process hooks with full typed context.

## Hooks vs plugins vs permissions

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Block/observe by exit code from any language | hooks |
| Rewrite args, mutate definitions, custom tools, auth | plugins |
| Static policy by tool + pattern | [permissions](../using/permissions.md) |
