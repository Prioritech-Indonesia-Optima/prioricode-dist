description: "SKILL.md files that teach PrioriCode procedures on demand — format, discovery paths, remote skill packs, and how the model invokes skills."

A skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` inside: instructions for one procedure, loaded *when needed* instead of permanently bloating every prompt. It's the difference between a poster on the wall and a laminated card the agent pulls out for the job.

## The format

```
.prioricode/skills/release-checklist/
├── SKILL.md
├── changelog-template.md      ← sibling files: resources the skill points at
└── scripts/verify.sh
```

```markdown
---
name: release-checklist
description: Run the pre-release checklist for this repo — lint, typecheck, smoke-test, changelog.

# Release checklist

1. Run `bun run lint` and `bun run typecheck`; stop on failure and report which one broke.
2. Start `bun run dev`, exercise the changed flow, paste what you saw.
3. Draft the changelog entry using [changelog-template.md](changelog-template.md) — read it with the Read tool.
4. Never push to main yourself; leave that human.
```

Only two frontmatter fields are recognized: `name` (required) and `description`. The **description is the advertisement** — every skill's name+description lands in the system prompt, and the model decides from that one line whether to load the body. Make it say *when to use*, not just *what it is* (this repo's own skills are written that way; inspect `~/.local/share/prioricode` equivalents with `/skills`).

The body becomes the loaded content, delivered with the skill's directory and a sampled file list, so relative references (`changelog-template.md`) resolve for the agent.

## Where skills are found

Scanned at startup, in this order:

1. `~/.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md` and `~/.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md` — external skill homes, so skills from other agent ecosystems just work. Turn them off with `PRIORICODE_DISABLE_EXTERNAL_SKILLS=1` (or the broader `PRIORICODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE=1`).
2. Every PrioriCode config directory — `~/.config/prioricode`, `~/.prioricode`, and `.prioricode/` from your cwd up to the worktree root — under `{skill,skills}/**/SKILL.md`.
3. Extra paths from config:

```jsonc
{ "skills": { "paths": ["../shared-skills", "~/work/skills"] } }
```

4. Remote packs: `skills.urls` —

```jsonc
{ "skills": { "urls": ["https://skills.example.com/acme"] } }
```

Each URL must serve `index.json` shaped as `{ "skills": [{ "name", "files": ["SKILL.md", …], "version"? }] }`. Files are cached under the cache dir with atomic version-swaps, so an updated pack lands whole or not at all.

Duplicate names: last one wins and you get a warning — intentional, project skills override global ones. A built-in skill (`customize-prioricode`, for editing PrioriCode's own config) ships with the binary and can be overridden on disk.

## Using them

- **`/skills`** in the TUI lists discovered skills and inserts the chosen one into your prompt.
- **The model loads them itself** via the `skill` tool when a task matches a description — the tool injects that skill's full body into the conversation.
- **Permissions:** skill loading asks under the `skill` permission with the skill name as pattern — `"skill": { "my-*": "allow", "*": "ask" }` tunes the noise.

:::tip
Skill bodies can include shell snippets as *instructions*, but the skill file itself is just prompt material — it runs nothing. Anything executable happens because the agent decides to run it, which means it still passes through [permissions](../using/permissions.md). That's by design.

## Skills vs commands vs agents

| Want | Build |
| --- | --- |
| The agent should know *how* to do procedure X when relevant | skill |
| *You* want to trigger a canned prompt by name | [custom command](commands.md) |
| A whole different persona with its own tools/model | [custom agent](../using/agents.md) |
